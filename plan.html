<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef Orchestra website's purpose is to increase ticket sales by 30%. As well as boost artists, supporters and sponsors by 10% while
 informing and attracting potential artists and members especially younger members of the Townsville-based Orchestra.
 In addition, the site is planned to maintain and inform existing members of upcoming rehearsals, concerts, as well as new members.
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>
 Due to lack of the client giving a quantifiable number it has been decided that a 30% increase in ticket sales would be reasonable. 
 Another factor that decides it's success is if artists, supporters, sponsors increase by 10%. 
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef Orchestra wish to grab the attention of mostly a younger demographic, especially high school students but also any orchestra enthusiasts no matter the gender or age. To achieve this the website will use a simplistic yet professional design to make it appealing to younger audiences as they are better accustomed to higher standards in websites.The website will be made so its text is scannable as this demographic are more likely to stay on the website due to it being less of a chore to read, since younger audiences will have lower attention spans. The site will incorporate nice radiant colors like the orange to portray coral, blues for the ocean and an off color white so that not everything else is white.
