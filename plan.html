<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef Orchestra website is intended to inform potential members and artists of the Townsville-based Orchestra.
    The client would like the website to attract more members, sponsors and musicians to join their community. In addition
    The site is planned to maintain and inform existing members of upcoming rehearsals, concerts, as well as new members.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>
 Due to lack of the client giving a quantifiable number It has been decided that a 30% increase in attendence and ticket sales would be reasonable. 
 Another factor that decides it's success is if artists, supporters, sponsors increase by 10%. 
    </p>


<h2>Target Audience</h2>
