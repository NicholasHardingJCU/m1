<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>Any details required to test the site, including instructions if needed, outstanding issues
    (like things that look as though they work but don't)</p>
    <p>- Asked a few users to go onto our webpage and find any issues with links not working or if forms would submit without required cells being filled. Just generally find any issues and to give harsh feedback.</p>
    <p>- Link errors were found on some pages that we must have forgotten about and some images did not have alt names, also after many complaints about the navbar and footer not being the same size as the content it was extended.</p>
<h2>References</h2>
<p>Some images that weren't provided were taken from their <a ref="https://www.facebook.com/nqorchestra/">facebook</a> page.</p>
<p>Jquery codes were optained through here: <a ref="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/">Link</a></p>
<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>Your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong>Less workload for each member as we were a larger group than others.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Having more members resulted in complications in regard to data transfer and handling. More members meant more communication.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> We were able to provide help to each other in the group to gain a better understanding of web design and coding.</p>
